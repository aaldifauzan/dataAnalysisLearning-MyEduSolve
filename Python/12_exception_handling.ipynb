    ">In programming, there are two types of errors: syntax errors and exceptions. While syntax errors are straightforward and are detected during the code writing phase, exceptions are more challenging. Exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of the program. These errors can be due to various reasons, such as invalid input file not found, division by zero, etc.\n",

    "> Logical errors, often known as exception, occur during the execution of the program. These are not syntax error, but they can cause the program to behave unexpectedly or even crash. For instance, trying to open a file that doesn't exist or attempting to dicide by zero are examples of exceptions.\n",

    ">\n",
    "> Python has several built-in exceptions that can be triggered during the execution of a program. These exception are integrated into the Python runtime and are raised when specific error conditions occur. Some of the commonly encountered built-in exceptions include:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. `ValueError` : Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but an inappropriate value\n",
    "> 2. `TypeError` : Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.\n",
    "> 3. `IndexError` : Raised when a sequence subscript is out of range.\n",
    "> 4. `KeyError` : Raised when a dictionary key is not found.\n",
    "> 5. `FileNotFoundError` : Raised when a file or directory is requested but doesn't exist.\n",
