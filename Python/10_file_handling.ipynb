    ">\n",
    "> In Python, you can open a file using the `open()` function. The `open()` function takes two parameters: the name of the file you want to open and the mode in which you want to open and the mode in which you want to open the file. The different modes you can use to open a file in Python are:\n",
    "> - `'r'` Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist.\n",
    "> - `'a'` Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist.\n",
    "> - `'w'` Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist.\n",
    "> - `'x'` Create - Creates the specified file, error if the file exists.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In addition to these basic modes, you can also specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode:\n",
    "> - `'t'` Text - Default value. Text Mode.\n",
    "> - `'b'` Binary - Binary mode (e.g., images)."
